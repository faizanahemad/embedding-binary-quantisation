\section*{Introduction}  
  
ModernBERT is a next-generation encoder-only transformer model developed collaboratively by \emph{Answer.AI}, \emph{LightOn}, \emph{Johns Hopkins University}, \emph{NVIDIA}, and \emph{HuggingFace}. It is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional models like BERT by incorporating state-of-the-art architectural improvements, efficiency optimizations, and training methodologies. ModernBERT achieves superior performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, including classification, retrieval, and code-related applications, while being faster and more memory-efficient.  
  
\section{Motivation and Background}  
  
Despite the foundational impact of BERT in NLP, encoder-only models have not seen significant architectural updates to match recent advancements. Limitations of previous models include:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Short Sequence Length}: Traditional models like BERT are limited to processing sequences up to 512 tokens.  
    \item \textbf{Outdated Architectures}: Many models rely on legacy designs without incorporating recent innovations in transformer architectures.  
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Training and Inference}: High computational and memory costs limit the practical deployment of these models.  
    \item \textbf{Limited Training Data}: Prior models are often trained on less diverse and outdated datasets.  
\end{itemize}  
  
ModernBERT addresses these issues by integrating modern techniques, extending context length, and optimizing for efficiency.  
  
\section{Architectural Innovations}  
  
ModernBERT introduces several key architectural changes:  
  
\subsection{Extended Context Length}  
  
ModernBERT natively supports sequences up to 8,192 tokens, significantly increasing its ability to handle long documents and capture broader contexts.  
  
\subsection{Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)}  
  
Instead of absolute positional embeddings, ModernBERT utilizes Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), which enhance the model's ability to generalize to longer sequences.  
  
Mathematically, RoPE applies a rotation to the token embeddings:  
  
\[  
\text{RoPE}(x_m) = \begin{cases}  
x_m^{(2i)} \cos(m \theta_k) + x_m^{(2i+1)} \sin(m \theta_k) \\  
x_m^{(2i+1)} \cos(m \theta_k) - x_m^{(2i)} \sin(m \theta_k)  
\end{cases}  
\]  
  
where:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \( x_m^{(2i)} \) and \( x_m^{(2i+1)} \) are the even and odd components of the embedding at position \( m \).  
    \item \( \theta_k = \frac{1}{10000^{2i/d}} \), with \( d \) being the dimension of the model.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Alternating Attention Mechanism}  
  
ModernBERT employs an alternating global and local attention mechanism:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Global Attention}: Used every third layer, where each token attends to all tokens in the sequence.  
    \item \textbf{Local Attention}: In other layers, tokens attend only to a fixed window of surrounding tokens (e.g., 128 tokens).  
\end{itemize}  
  
This approach balances computational efficiency with the ability to capture long-range dependencies.  
  
\subsection{Activation Functions: GeGLU}  
  
The model replaces standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), specifically the GeGLU variant, defined as:  
  
\[  
\text{GeGLU}(x) = \left( x W^{(1)} + b^{(1)} \right) \odot \text{GELU}\left( x W^{(2)} + b^{(2)} \right)  
\]  
  
where:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \( x \) is the input vector.  
    \item \( W^{(1)}, W^{(2)} \) are weight matrices.  
    \item \( b^{(1)}, b^{(2)} \) are bias vectors.  
    \item \( \text{GELU}(\cdot) \) is the Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function.  
    \item \( \odot \) denotes element-wise multiplication.  
\end{itemize}  
  
This activation function enhances the model's expressiveness and performance.  
  
\subsection{Pre-Normalization and Bias Removal}  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Pre-Normalization}: Layer normalization is applied before the attention and feed-forward sub-layers to improve training stability.  
    \item \textbf{Bias Terms Removal}: Bias terms are removed from linear layers and LayerNorm layers, except for the final output layer, to allocate more capacity to the critical components.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\section{Efficiency Optimizations}  
  
\subsection{Unpadding Technique}  
  
ModernBERT employs an advanced unpadding technique, removing padding tokens before computations to reduce unnecessary processing. This leads to a 10-20\% improvement in efficiency.  
  
\subsection{Flash Attention}  
  
The model integrates Flash Attention mechanisms:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Flash Attention 2}: Used for global attention layers.  
    \item \textbf{Flash Attention 3}: Applied in local attention layers for further memory and computational efficiency.  
\end{itemize}  
  
Flash Attention reduces memory bandwidth and improves speed during training and inference.  
  
\subsection{Hardware Optimization}  
  
ModernBERT is designed to maximize performance on common hardware, including:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item NVIDIA GPUs like T4, A100, and consumer GPUs like RTX 4090.  
    \item Utilizes tensor cores effectively by adjusting model dimensions and operations.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\section{Training Methodology}  
  
\subsection{Data Preparation}  
  
The model is trained on a massive dataset of 2 trillion tokens, encompassing:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Web Data}: Diverse English text from the internet.  
    \item \textbf{Code Data}: Extensive code repositories to enhance code understanding.  
    \item \textbf{Scientific Literature}: Papers and articles to improve domain-specific knowledge.  
\end{itemize}  
  
A modern BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 50,368 tokens is used.  
  
\subsection{Training Phases}  
  
Training is conducted in three main phases:

\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Tokens Processed}: 50 billion.  
    \item \textbf{Objective}: Refine the model with emphasis on stability and performance.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Optimization Techniques}  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{StableAdamW Optimizer}: Combines benefits of AdamW and Adafactor for stable training.  
    \item \textbf{Sequence Packing}: Efficiently packs sequences to optimize batch processing.  
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate Scheduling}: WSD schedule helps in gradual warmup, stable training, and controlled decay.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\section{Mathematical Formulations}  
  
\subsection{Self-Attention Mechanism}  
  
The scaled dot-product attention is computed as:  
  
\[  
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{Softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V  
\]  
  
where:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \( Q = X W_Q \) (queries)  
    \item \( K = X W_K \) (keys)  
    \item \( V = X W_V \) (values)  
    \item \( X \) is the input matrix.  
    \item \( W_Q, W_K, W_V \) are weight matrices.  
    \item \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Layer Normalization}  
  
Applied before sub-layers:  
  
\[  
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \gamma + \beta  
\]  
  
where:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \( \mu \) is the mean of \( x \).  
    \item \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of \( x \).  
    \item \( \gamma, \beta \) are learned parameters.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Gated Linear Units (GLUs)}  
  
The GeGLU activation function enhances model capacity:  
  
\[  
\begin{align*}  
y &= \text{GeGLU}(x) \\  
&= \left( x W^{(1)} \right) \odot \text{GELU}\left( x W^{(2)} \right)  
\end{align*}  
\]
