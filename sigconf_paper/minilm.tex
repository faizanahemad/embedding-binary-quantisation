\begin{abstract}  
Transformer-based models like BERT have achieved remarkable success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their large sizes and computational demands make them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. MINILM is a model compression technique that addresses this challenge by employing deep self-attention distillation. This document provides an extensive explanation of MINILM, detailing its motivations, methodologies, mathematical formulations, and advantages.

\section{Introduction}  
  
Pre-trained Transformer models, such as BERT \cite{devlin2018bert}, have set new benchmarks in NLP tasks owing to their ability to capture complex language patterns through self-attention mechanisms. Despite their success, the substantial number of parameters (often hundreds of millions) poses significant challenges:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{High Computational Costs}: Large models require significant computational power, hindering real-time inference.  
    \item \textbf{Memory Limitations}: Deploying these models on devices with limited memory (e.g., mobile devices) is impractical.  
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption}: High energy demands are unsustainable for large-scale or edge deployments.  
\end{itemize}  
  
To address these challenges, model compression techniques aim to reduce the size and computational requirements of large models while retaining their performance. MINILM (Miniature Language Model) introduces a novel approach called \textit{deep self-attention distillation} to achieve this goal.  
  
\section{Background and Motivation}  
  
\subsection{Transformer Architecture}  
  
Transformers consist of stacked layers, each comprising two main components:  
  
\begin{enumerate}  
    \item \textbf{Self-Attention Mechanism}: Allows the model to weigh the relevance of different words in a sequence when encoding a word representation.  
    \item \textbf{Feed-Forward Networks}: Apply non-linear transformations to the output of the self-attention mechanism.  
\end{enumerate}  
  
\subsection{Limitations of Existing Compression Methods}  
  
Prior compression methods include:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{DistilBERT} \cite{sanh2019distilbert}: Uses knowledge distillation to train a smaller model but requires the student to have the same architecture as the teacher.  
    \item \textbf{TinyBERT} \cite{jiao2019tinybert}: Employs layer-to-layer distillation, necessitating layer mapping between teacher and student.  
    \item \textbf{MobileBERT} \cite{sun2020mobilebert}: Introduces bottleneck structures to match hidden dimensions but increases architectural complexity.  
\end{itemize}  
  
These methods often impose constraints on the student model's architecture and require additional parameters or complex training procedures.  
  
\section{MINILM Methodology}  
  
MINILM introduces \textbf{deep self-attention distillation} to overcome the limitations of previous methods.  
  
\subsection{Deep Self-Attention Distillation}  
  
The core idea is to train the student model to mimic the self-attention behavior of the teacher model's last Transformer layer. This approach offers several advantages:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Architectural Flexibility}: The student model can have a different number of layers and hidden dimensions.  
    \item \textbf{Reduced Complexity}: Eliminates the need for layer-to-layer mapping.  
    \item \textbf{Parameter Efficiency}: No additional parameters are required to match hidden dimensions.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Self-Attention Mechanism}  
  
In the self-attention mechanism, each token in the input sequence attends to all other tokens to generate contextualized representations.  
  
\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation}  
  
Given an input sequence $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $n$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the hidden dimension, the computations for each attention head are:  
  
\begin{align}  
    Q &= H W^Q \\  
    K &= H W^K \\  
    V &= H W^V  
\end{align}  
  
where $W^Q, W^K, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_k}$ are learnable weight matrices, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the queries and keys.  
  
The attention scores and outputs are computed as:  
  
\begin{align}  
    A &= \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) \\  
    O &= A V  
\end{align}  
  
Here, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the attention distribution, and $O$ is the output of the self-attention mechanism.  
  
\subsection{Knowledge Distillation Objectives}  
  
MINILM employs two primary objectives for distillation:  
  
\subsubsection{Self-Attention Distribution Transfer}  
  
The student model learns to mimic the teacher's attention distributions by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:  
  
\begin{equation}  
    L_{AT} = \frac{1}{h n} \sum_{i=1}^{h} \sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{KL}\left( A^T_{i,j} \| A^S_{i,j} \right)  
\end{equation}  
  
where:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item $h$ is the number of attention heads.  
    \item $A^T_{i,j}$ and $A^S_{i,j}$ are the attention distributions of the teacher and student, respectively, for head $i$ at position $j$.  
    \item $D_{KL}$ denotes the KL divergence between two probability distributions.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsubsection{Value-Relation Transfer}  
  
To capture more nuanced relationships, MINILM introduces the transfer of value relations:  
  
\begin{align}  
    VR_T &= \text{softmax}\left( \frac{V^T {V^T}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) \\  
    VR_S &= \text{softmax}\left( \frac{V^S {V^S}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)  
\end{align}  
  
The loss function for value-relation transfer is:  
  
\begin{equation}  
    L_{VR} = \frac{1}{h n} \sum_{i=1}^{h} \sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{KL}\left( VR^T_{i,j} \| VR^S_{i,j} \right)  
\end{equation}  
  
\subsubsection{Combined Loss Function}  
  
The total loss for training the student model is:  
  
\begin{equation}  
    L = L_{AT} + L_{VR}  
\end{equation}  
  
This combined objective ensures the student model learns both the attention distributions and the value relationships from the teacher model.  
  
\subsection{Teacher Assistant Strategy}  
  
When the size difference between the teacher and student models is substantial, a \textbf{teacher assistant} can be employed:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item The teacher assistant is an intermediate-sized model distilled from the teacher.  
    \item The student model is then distilled from the teacher assistant.  
    \item This hierarchical distillation facilitates smoother knowledge transfer.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\section{Training Details}

\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Model Architectures}  
  
Examples of student model configurations:  
  
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{MINILM-12}: 12 layers, hidden size of 384, 33M parameters.  
    \item \textbf{MINILM-6}: 6 layers, hidden size of 384, 22M parameters.  
    \item \textbf{MINILM-6 (Hidden Size 768)}: 6 layers, hidden size of 768, 66M parameters.  
\end{itemize}  
  
\subsection{Fine-tuning on Downstream Tasks}  
  
After pre-training, MINILM models can be fine-tuned on various NLP tasks without the need for task-specific distillation.
