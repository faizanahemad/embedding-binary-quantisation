# Rough idea notes.

### Idea Phase 1.
Now I have an idea for using these quantization ideas for quantization of vector embeddings into binary in each dim of the vector. This enables us to use simply count the occurrence of ones in the xor of two vectors to check their similarity. 
In a simple form of embedding quantisation we can simply make a embedding value (one single value) as 0 if actual value < 0 and 1 if actual value > 0, thus making the whole embedding vector having only 0 or 1.
As you can see from quantisation methods (Non-Uniform Quantization methods) that this is a uniform quantisation approach. Instead I can take a non-uniform approach on the embedding outputs where the boundary will not be 0 but rather be adaptively determined for each dimension separately (resulting in n boundaries for n dim vector embedding) based on the embedding model and perhaps based on the RAG or embedding dataset as well.
Can you think of various ways we can do this using Non-Uniform Quantization methods and Binary Quantization methods. How can we train this additional part on top of the embedding model?

### Idea Phase 2.
Now lets think of an even more aggresive idea. We can not only binary quantise the vector embeddings but also reduce their dimension. This can be done via Matryoska embeddings. Drop the last few dimensions in a matryoska embedding trained model.
Or even more aggresive but better approach, for first few dimensions where most information is concentrated we use our usual method of adaptively binary quantising the vector embeddings based on the dataset and model, through some method that we can come up with later. Here the input dimension and output dimension of our method has one to one correspondence but the output is binary not fp16 or fp32. But for later dimensions which hold less information, we can actually quantise two dimensions (or more dimensions from input) into a single binary output dimension. For example, lets say till dim=256 we take dimensions as is and then binary quant them (quant the vector embeddings from the model), then after dim=256 we say for dim 257, 258 that `output=0 if dim{257} < k1 and dim{258} < k2 else 1` where k1 and k2 are constants that we need to determine from our methodology which helps in quantisation to binary from float. 

And finally taking it to most extreme, lets train a Neural network that takes in the embeddings from the embedding model as input then gives a smaller dim representation or embedding with the constrain that somehow makes the final output of NN 0 or 1. I am not sure how to train this NN since this has discrete outputs which is hard to backprop. and the training needs to done how vector embedding models are trained. This could work very well or just not work at all.

Can you first of all summarise and put all my ideas in one place. Then look at each of them and think how they can be implemented and what challenges we might face with them. Think of the best strategy to implement them and suggest based on that. Go in depth and think very carefully and in detail.

# Summarised Idea notes.

Certainly! Let's break down your innovative idea into a structured framework with detailed stages and implementation strategies.

### Overview of the Idea
Your concept revolves around enhancing the efficiency of embedding vectors by combining binary quantization with dimensionality reduction. This involves leveraging hierarchical embedding structures, adaptive quantization, and potentially neural networks to achieve compact and effective binary representations.

### Stages of the Idea

#### Stage 1: Matryoshka-Based Binary Reduction
1. **Concept**: Utilize Matryoshka embeddings, which inherently have a hierarchical structure, to drop less informative dimensions while maintaining the integrity of the most critical information.
2. **Implementation**:
   - **Train with Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)**: Ensure embeddings are nested, allowing for effective truncation without significant information loss.
   - **Binary Quantization**: Apply adaptive thresholds to convert floating-point values to binary, focusing on the most informative dimensions.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Drop the last few dimensions post-training, leveraging the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings.
3. **Challenges**:
   - **Information Loss**: Dropping dimensions can lead to loss of critical information.
   - **Quantization Noise**: Binary quantization introduces errors that may degrade performance.
   - **Balancing Trade-offs**: Finding the optimal number of dimensions to drop while maintaining performance.

#### Stage 2: Hybrid Adaptive Quantization
1. **Concept**: Implement a mixed strategy where the first few dimensions are adaptively binary quantized, and later dimensions are combined to form single binary outputs.
2. **Implementation**:
   - **Initial Dimensions**: Apply one-to-one adaptive binary quantization for the most informative dimensions (e.g., up to dimension 256).
   - **Later Dimensions**: Combine multiple dimensions into single binary outputs using thresholds determined through statistical analysis or optimization.
   - **Quantization Logic**: For example, for dimensions 257 and 258, use a condition like `output = 0 if dim_257 < k_1 and dim_258 < k_2 else 1`, where \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) are thresholds.
3. **Challenges**:
   - **Threshold Selection**: Determining optimal thresholds can be complex.
   - **Information Loss**: Combining dimensions may lead to loss of important variance.
   - **Correlation Between Dimensions**: Highly correlated dimensions may reduce quantization effectiveness.

#### Stage 3: Neural Network Compression
1. **Concept**: Train a neural network to transform high-dimensional embeddings into smaller binary embeddings, addressing the challenge of discrete outputs.
2. **Implementation**:
   - **Network Design**: Design a neural network that reduces dimensionality and outputs binary values.
   - **Continuous Relaxations**: Use sigmoid activations or the Gumbel-Softmax trick to approximate discrete sampling.
   - **Training Procedure**: Use loss functions that account for tasks like classification or retrieval and encourage binarization.
3. **Challenges**:
   - **Non-Differentiability**: Discrete outputs hinder gradient-based optimization.
   - **Performance Degradation**: Reduced dimensionality and binarization may lead to information loss.
   - **Training Stability**: Ensuring stable and convergent training due to gradient approximation.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze the distribution of embedding values to determine initial parameters for quantization and dimensionality reduction.

2. **Parameter Selection**:
   - Use statistical methods to select parameters like early dimension thresholds and combination sizes for later dimensions.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Implement Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to make embeddings robust to quantization noise.
   - Use validation sets to fine-tune thresholds and ensure similarity preservation.
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like compression ratio, similarity preservation, retrieval accuracy, and computation time.

4. **Optimization and Iteration**:
   - Begin with simpler models and progressively incorporate complexity based on empirical results.
   - Regularly monitor performance metrics to balance efficiency with task accuracy.

### Conclusion
Your idea presents a comprehensive approach to embedding compression by integrating binary quantization and dimensionality reduction. By leveraging Matryoshka embeddings, adaptive quantization, and neural networks, you can achieve efficient and effective embeddings suitable for large-scale applications. The key to success lies in thoughtful training, data-driven threshold determination, and continuous performance monitoring to ensure that efficiency gains do not compromise performance.
