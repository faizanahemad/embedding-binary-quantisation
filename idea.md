# Rough idea notes.

### Idea Phase 1.
Now I have an idea for using these quantization ideas for quantization of vector embeddings into binary in each dim of the vector. This enables us to use simply count the occurrence of ones in the xor of two vectors to check their similarity. 
In a simple form of embedding quantisation we can simply make a embedding value (one single value) as 0 if actual value < 0 and 1 if actual value > 0, thus making the whole embedding vector having only 0 or 1.
As you can see from quantisation methods (Non-Uniform Quantization methods) that this is a uniform quantisation approach. Instead I can take a non-uniform approach on the embedding outputs where the boundary will not be 0 but rather be adaptively determined for each dimension separately (resulting in n boundaries for n dim vector embedding) based on the embedding model and perhaps based on the RAG or embedding dataset as well.
Can you think of various ways we can do this using Non-Uniform Quantization methods and Binary Quantization methods. How can we train this additional part on top of the embedding model?

### Idea Phase 2.
Now lets think of an even more aggresive idea. We can not only binary quantise the vector embeddings but also reduce their dimension. This can be done via Matryoska embeddings. Drop the last few dimensions in a matryoska embedding trained model.
Or even more aggresive but better approach, for first few dimensions where most information is concentrated we use our usual method of adaptively binary quantising the vector embeddings based on the dataset and model, through some method that we can come up with later. Here the input dimension and output dimension of our method has one to one correspondence but the output is binary not fp16 or fp32. But for later dimensions which hold less information, we can actually quantise two dimensions (or more dimensions from input) into a single binary output dimension. For example, lets say till dim=256 we take dimensions as is and then binary quant them (quant the vector embeddings from the model), then after dim=256 we say for dim 257, 258 that `output=0 if dim{257} < k1 and dim{258} < k2 else 1` where k1 and k2 are constants that we need to determine from our methodology which helps in quantisation to binary from float. 

And finally taking it to most extreme, lets train a Neural network that takes in the embeddings from the embedding model as input then gives a smaller dim representation or embedding with the constrain that somehow makes the final output of NN 0 or 1. I am not sure how to train this NN since this has discrete outputs which is hard to backprop. and the training needs to done how vector embedding models are trained. This could work very well or just not work at all.

Can you first of all summarise and put all my ideas in one place. Then look at each of them and think how they can be implemented and what challenges we might face with them. Think of the best strategy to implement them and suggest based on that. Go in depth and think very carefully and in detail.

# Summarised Idea notes.

Certainly! Let's break down your innovative idea into a structured framework with detailed stages and implementation strategies.

### Overview of the Idea
Your concept revolves around enhancing the efficiency of embedding vectors by combining binary quantization with dimensionality reduction. This involves leveraging hierarchical embedding structures, adaptive quantization, and potentially neural networks to achieve compact and effective binary representations.

### Stages of the Idea

#### Stage 1: Matryoshka-Based Binary Reduction
1. **Concept**: Utilize Matryoshka embeddings, which inherently have a hierarchical structure, to drop less informative dimensions while maintaining the integrity of the most critical information.
2. **Implementation**:
   - **Train with Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)**: Ensure embeddings are nested, allowing for effective truncation without significant information loss.
   - **Binary Quantization**: Apply adaptive thresholds to convert floating-point values to binary, focusing on the most informative dimensions.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Drop the last few dimensions post-training, leveraging the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings.
3. **Challenges**:
   - **Information Loss**: Dropping dimensions can lead to loss of critical information.
   - **Quantization Noise**: Binary quantization introduces errors that may degrade performance.
   - **Balancing Trade-offs**: Finding the optimal number of dimensions to drop while maintaining performance.

#### Stage 2: Hybrid Adaptive Quantization
1. **Concept**: Implement a mixed strategy where the first few dimensions are adaptively binary quantized, and later dimensions are combined to form single binary outputs.
2. **Implementation**:
   - **Initial Dimensions**: Apply one-to-one adaptive binary quantization for the most informative dimensions (e.g., up to dimension 256).
   - **Later Dimensions**: Combine multiple dimensions into single binary outputs using thresholds determined through statistical analysis or optimization.
   - **Quantization Logic**: For example, for dimensions 257 and 258, use a condition like `output = 0 if dim_257 < k_1 and dim_258 < k_2 else 1`, where \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) are thresholds.
3. **Challenges**:
   - **Threshold Selection**: Determining optimal thresholds can be complex.
   - **Information Loss**: Combining dimensions may lead to loss of important variance.
   - **Correlation Between Dimensions**: Highly correlated dimensions may reduce quantization effectiveness.

#### Stage Later (TBD): Neural Network Compression
1. **Concept**: Train a neural network to transform high-dimensional embeddings into smaller binary embeddings, addressing the challenge of discrete outputs.
2. **Implementation**:
   - **Network Design**: Design a neural network that reduces dimensionality and outputs binary values.
   - **Continuous Relaxations**: Use sigmoid activations or the Gumbel-Softmax trick to approximate discrete sampling.
   - **Training Procedure**: Use loss functions that account for tasks like classification or retrieval and encourage binarization.
3. **Challenges**:
   - **Non-Differentiability**: Discrete outputs hinder gradient-based optimization.
   - **Performance Degradation**: Reduced dimensionality and binarization may lead to information loss.
   - **Training Stability**: Ensuring stable and convergent training due to gradient approximation.

# Improved Binary Quantization with Adaptive Pruning

Our improved binary quantization method advances beyond simple thresholding (x > 0 ? 1 : 0) and learned per-dimension thresholds by introducing a sophisticated system combining adaptive scaling, intelligent pruning, and soft quantization training. At its core, the method learns both per-dimension scales (s) and thresholds (t), where scales help normalize dimension importance and thresholds adapt to the data distribution. The forward pass involves scaling the input embeddings (x̂ = x ⊙ (s ⊙ m)), adjusting thresholds using Hessian information (t̂ = t ⊙ √(diag(H) + ε)), and applying soft quantization through a temperature-controlled sigmoid (q = σ((x̂ - t̂)/τ)). Importance scores are computed using a combination of gradient magnitude, feature magnitude, and historical information (α = λ₁|∇x| + λ₂|x| + λ₃α_{t-1}), which then influence both the quantization process and pruning decisions. The training employs three loss components: similarity preservation (cosine similarity), regularization (keeping thresholds small and scales near unity), and entropy loss (pushing outputs toward binary values). Position-aware pruning is implemented where earlier dimensions are harder to prune (threshold_i = base_threshold / exp(-decay * i)), and pruning only begins after half the training epochs.

The training process starts with initialization (thresholds ≈ N(0, 0.01), scales = 1, importance scores = 1, temperature = 0.1) and progresses through two phases: first focusing on learning scales/thresholds, then introducing progressive dimension pruning. Key hyperparameters include dimension_importance_decay = 0.01 and importance_momentum = 0.99, with the temperature parameter controlling the smoothness of quantization. The method maintains running averages of importance scores for stability and uses second-order (Hessian) information to optimize quantization points. During training, dimensions are pruned based on their importance scores, with the pruning threshold gradually increasing with epochs (threshold = 0.1 * (1 + epoch / num_epochs)). Rather than removing pruned dimensions, their scales are zeroed out to maintain dimensional compatibility. The method draws inspiration from GPTQ for quantization, Movement Pruning for importance scoring, and employs the Straight-Through Estimator concept for training. This approach achieves better quantization by adapting to data distribution, enables efficient compression through intelligent pruning, and maintains training stability through its soft quantization process and multiple loss components. The entire system is designed to automatically handle device placement, track active dimensions, record importance scores, and monitor various loss components, making it both theoretically sound and practically implementable.

The implementation includes several crucial details for robustness and efficiency. The Hessian diagonal approximation is computed after each backward pass and maintained with exponential moving average (momentum = 0.9) to ensure stability. The importance scores combine both local and temporal information, where local importance is computed from current batch gradients and magnitudes, while temporal consistency is maintained through momentum averaging. The entropy loss weight is gradually increased (min(0.1, 0.01 * epoch)) to allow initial flexibility in learning and later encourage binary outputs. During inference, the quantized embeddings can be efficiently compared using Hamming distance (XOR + popcount) operations, as the output is binary. The pruning mask is maintained as a boolean tensor and applied both to scales and importance scores, ensuring pruned dimensions remain pruned. The position importance decay (exp(-dimension_importance_decay * dimension_index)) creates a natural bias towards keeping earlier dimensions, which typically contain more important information in many embedding models. Training statistics are comprehensively tracked, including per-epoch losses, importance score evolution, pruning ratios, and temperature values, enabling detailed analysis of the quantization process. The method also includes gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0) to prevent training instability and uses careful device management to ensure efficient GPU utilization.

## Motivation & Background
